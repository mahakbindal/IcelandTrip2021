      <h3>Geothermal Spas & Hot Springs</h3>
      <p>We went to four different spas: Laugarvatn Fontana, the Blue Lagoon,
        Reykjadalur Natural Hot Springs, and the Sky Lagoon. The natural hot
        springs was a crowd favorite as the river was located in a beautiful
        valley that we had to hike up to. The other spas were man-made, but heated
        with geothermal energy. We enjoyed Lagarvatn Fontana and the Sky Lagoon
        because they were more interactive and were more scenic. The Blue Lagoon
        was nice as well, but more touristy and the silica in the water didn't
        feel very pleasant.

      <h3>Glacier Hike & Lagoon Kayaking</h3>
      <p>We did a glacier hike in the Vatnajokull area. This activity was guided, and
        the company provided the necessary safety gear (helmet, crampons,
        harnesses, etc.). Other than the vague directions the company gave to arrive
        at the location, the hike was great! The entire experience was about 3 hours,
        with 1 hour actually on the ice. I would have enjoyed spending more time on
        the glacier. As for kayaking in Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon, the activity was
        cancelled due to bad weather, and large pieces of ice blocking the path.

      <h3>Golden Circle</h3>
      <p>The Golden Circle is about a 200 mile drive going through some Iceland's
        most popular attractions. We first went to Thingvellir National Park where we
        saw unique rock formations and the continental drift between the
        North American and Eurasian plates. We then went to Gullfoss, which is a large
        waterfall, comparable to Niagara Falls. We also visited Haukadalur Valley, where
        we saw active geysers.

      <h3>Volcano Hike</h3>
      <p>The volcano hike was by far one of my favorite activities. It is currently
        erupting, and conditions are constantly changing. We were able to see the lava
        fields, and flowing, glowing magma. We also hiked for about an hour to see
        the crater, and saw the lava geysers. The weather was not ideal, but was
        still a very euphoric, and once in a lifetime experience.
