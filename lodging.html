      <h2>Airbnb in Reykjavík</h2>
      <p>This airbnb was located in downtown Reykjavík, which was very close to
        various restaurants, grocery stores, and notable landmarks like the church
        and Sun Voyager. The apartment itself was very homey, with traditional
        Iceland architecture, making the stay all the more special.

      <h2>Vík Apartments</h2>
      <p>Most of the lodging accomodations in Vík are on the pricier side, and
        this was one of the cheapest ones we found. It was very nice, with a full
        kitchen, private washer and dryer, and an ocean view. This was my favorite
        place in terms of lodging.

      <h2>Guesthouse in Hofn</h2>
      <p>Like Vík, housing accomodations are also very expensive, but this was our
        cheapest stay. My family and I were only staying for a night, arriving late,
        and leaving early in the morning, so we decided to live in a guesthouse, and
        paid a little extra for a private bathroom. The stay overall was pleasant,
        and just what we needed for the amount of time we were staying there for.
