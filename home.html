        <h2> Covid-19 Precauctions</h2>
      </div>
      <p>There are no covid cases in Iceland, and most of our activities were <br>
        outdoors, so masks were not required anywhere. For the journey there, my <br>
        entire family is vaccinated so we did not have to take any tests prior to <br>
        departing – we did have to fill out a pre-registration form online on <br>
        Iceland's travel website. We were also required to take a test upon landing, <br>
        and received the results within five hours. While leaving for home, we were <br>
        required to take a test no more than 72 hours prior to departure, for which <br>
        we scheduled while we were in Iceland. The process was pretty smooth, and <br>
        efficient
